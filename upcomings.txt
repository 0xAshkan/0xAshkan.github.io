It consists of two stages: online preliminaries and offline finals. Contestants will compete in a Jeopardy-style format using the competition platform provided by the organizers. The online preliminaries will be conducted using the Android emulator environment, while the offline finals will involve the use of actual Android devices.\r\n\r\nThe organizers have intentionally embedded identical or similar vulnerabilities in different versions of the Android system and will provide the vulnerability information to the contestants. Contestants will need to exploit the pre-embedded vulnerabilities to obtain flags.\r\n\r\nThe online preliminaries are scheduled to take place on August 26, 2023, at 10:00 AM (UTC+8) and end at August 28, 2023, at 10:00 AM(UTC+8), which will last for 48 hours.\r\n\r\nThe AVSS Contest provides challenges for cybersecurity enthusiasts of all levels. Beginners can get their feet wet with our introductory events, while experts can test their skills against our advanced scenarios. Our range of difficulty ensures an engaging experience for participants at any point in their cybersecurity journey. \r\n\r\nThis contest is the perfect opportunity to develop new skills, pursue your cybersecurity passions, and connect with others in the community. Mark your calendars and get ready for an immersive cybersecurity challenge like no other.
